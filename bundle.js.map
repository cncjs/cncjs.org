Any piece of metal nearby can act as an antenna for electrical interference.</li>\\n<li>Separate your motor driver cables and spindle cables from your signal cables (USB and limit switch wires).  The current flowing through the motor and spindle cables can induce electrical signals into nearby cables, causing interference.  This may be more difficult than it seems.

Any piece of metal nearby can act as an antenna for electrical interference.</li>\\n<li>Separate your motor driver cables and spindle cables from your signal cables (USB and limit switch wires).  The current flowing through the motor and spindle cables can induce electrical signals into nearby cables, causing interference.  This may be more difficult than it seems.  Basically, just make sure they don’t run parallel while touching.  If they do touch (like at a mounting point), make sure they cross and go on different paths.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"troubleshoot-electron-app-on-windows\\\">Troubleshoot Electron app on Windows</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Go to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/electron/electron/releases\\\">https://github.com/electron/electron/releases</a>, and download a zip file that matches your target platform.
