#### Important Notice

By now the OS X app is signed by a non-Apple issued Code Signing certificate, if you have Gatekeeper enabled on your Mac, a warning message will appear, informing you that the app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

If you see the warning, you can go to the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences, where you will see a message under the Gatekeeper settings about the recently blocked program. Click unlock in Security & Privacy pane and select "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere", then you will be able to continue program execution.
After that, you can restore the setting to default. Gatekeeper won't show you the warning again.
